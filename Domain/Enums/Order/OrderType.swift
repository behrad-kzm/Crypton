public enum OrderType: String, Codable {
  case Limit // The default order type. Specify an orderQty and price.
  case Market //A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or your bankruptcy price is reached, at which point it will cancel.
  case Stop //A Stop Market order. Specify an orderQty and stopPx. When the stopPx is reached, the order will be entered into the book. On sell orders, the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the stopPx. On buys, higher.
  case Note //Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered. Be sure that the required margin is available in your account so that it may trigger fully.
  case Close // Stops don't require an orderQty. See Execution Instructions below.
  case StopLimit //Like a Stop Market, but enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an orderQty, stopPx, and price.
  case MarketIfTouched // Similar to a Stop, but triggers are done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.
  case LimitIfTouched // As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.
