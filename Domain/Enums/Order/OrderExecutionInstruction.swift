public enum OrderExecutionInstruction: String {
  case ParticipateDoNotInitiate
  // Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement, it will cancel instead.
  case MarkPrice
  case LastPrice
  case IndexPrice
  // Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price. Use only one. By default, 'MarkPrice' is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of 'LastPeg'.
  case ReduceOnly
  // A 'ReduceOnly' order can only reduce your position, not increase it. If you have a 'ReduceOnly' limit order that rests in the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order quantity will be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple 'ReduceOnly' orders the least aggressive will be amended first.
  case Close
  //'Close' implies 'ReduceOnly'. A 'Close' order will cancel other active limit orders with the same side and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a 'Close' Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your position. If orderQty is not specified, a 'Close' order has an orderQty equal to your current position's size.
  // ** Note that a Close order without an orderQty requires a side, so that BitMEX knows if it should trigger above or below the stopPx.
